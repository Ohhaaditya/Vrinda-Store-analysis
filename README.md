Excel- Vrinda Store Data Analysis
🚀 Excited to Share My New Data Analytics Project! 📊

I recently worked on Vrinda Store Data Analysis, where I explored sales trends, customer behavior, and order patterns to gain actionable business insights.

🔍 Key highlights:
✅ Analyzed sales performance across different platforms (Myntra, Amazon, etc.).
✅ Identified purchasing trends based on age, gender, and location.
✅ Explored order status data to understand fulfillment efficiency.

🛠️ Tools used: Excel, SQL, and data visualization techniques.

This project helped me sharpen my data analysis skills and derive meaningful business insights. 📈

Would love to hear your thoughts! 💡
