Excel- Vrinda Store Data Analysis
Excited to Share My New Data Analytics Project! 

I recently worked on Vrinda Store Data Analysis, where I explored sales trends, customer behavior, and order patterns to gain actionable business insights.

Key highlights:
✅ Analyzed sales performance across different platforms (Myntra, Amazon, etc.).
✅ Identified purchasing trends based on age, gender, and location.
✅ Explored order status data to understand fulfillment efficiency.

Tools used: Excel, SQL, and data visualization techniques.
Would love to hear your thoughts!
